A few things to point out:
-some sections have the same class due to having the same layout
-some sections have classes with names that have nothing to do with the content due to me changing the website several times but using the same css (ex: X-terra was an old layout with an image of a X-terra covering)
-for people with disabilities I used <section> when starting new sections to indicate theat a new section started, <figure> and <figcaption> to indicate the presence of a figure with its caption, and the alt="" attribute to express the content of images
-some margins and font sizes are changed with the style attribute due to them being last second changes
-I want to add a fifth page that pops out when I press buy now on a vehicle in the vehicle page which I will use for project 2. However, these 4 should fullfill the requirements of the assignment for now.
